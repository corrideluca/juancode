/// Tracked-PR engine for juancode-it5: once a PR is "tracked", a dedicated agent
/// session watches it and the poller diffs the PR's reviewable activity each tick.
///
/// The philosophy is the same as the rest of juancode — we do NOT reimplement the
/// reviewing/fixing logic. The poller's only jobs are (1) detect *new* activity
/// (comments, reviews, CI status) via the real `gh` CLI, (2) classify each change
/// as auto-fixable vs needs-a-human-decision, and (3) hand the work to the genuine
/// agent CLI by writing a prompt into its session, exactly as if the user typed
/// it. The agent then uses its own `gh`/`git` to read CI logs, amend, and push.
///
/// Classification is deliberately a coarse, deterministic heuristic at this layer
/// (the agent makes the real call): an explicit `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review is a
/// human gate → needs-decision; plain comments, `COMMENTED` reviews, and CI going
/// red → auto-fix attempts. The injected fix prompt itself instructs the agent to
/// stop and escalate if it hits genuine ambiguity.

    comments or a change in CI status. When I do:
    - If it's an obvious fix (a lint/format/type error, a clearly-correct test fix, \
    or addressing a concrete review comment), make the change, commit, and push to \
    `\(branch)`.
    - If it needs a real decision (ambiguous feedback, conflicting requirements, a \
    risky refactor, or a non-obvious failure), STOP and explain what you need from \
    me instead of guessing.

    Codex review fallback: this PR is normally code-reviewed by Codex, and only added \
    to the Mergify merge queue after that review. If you see a comment saying Codex has \
    reached its usage limits for code reviews (i.e. it couldn't review this PR), do the \
    code review yourself: read the full diff, post your review as a PR comment, and fix \
    anything clearly wrong per the rules above. Once your review is clean and CI is \
    green, add the PR to the Mergify queue by commenting `@mergifyio queue` on it. If \
    your review turns up something that needs a real decision, STOP and escalate to me \
    instead of queueing.

    Start by reviewing the PR and its diff with `gh pr view \(number)` and \
