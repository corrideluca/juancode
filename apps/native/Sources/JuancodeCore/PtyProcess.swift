/// Owns a real pty whose child is an UNMODIFIED CLI binary (claude/codex),
/// spawned via `forkpty` + `execvp`. Promoted from the u34.1 spike and the
/// node-pty replacement at the heart of u34.2.
///
/// `execvp` inherits the parent process's `environ` verbatim — we never build an
/// envp, never inject a shadow HOME/CODEX_HOME — so user-scope MCP, connectors
/// and CLI config resolve exactly as in a normal terminal. Env fidelity is true
/// by construction. The child `chdir`s into the session's cwd before exec.
///
/// Output bytes are handed to `onData` on a private serial queue; `Session` fans
/// them out to N subscribers. This is the seam that replaces node-pty's onData.
///
/// Exit is detected by a dedicated thread blocked in `waitpid` — authoritative
/// for any exit cause (natural or killed), and free of the races that dog a
/// kqueue process source or master-fd EOF under concurrent load. Kill is a
/// terminal hangup: we close the master fd (the slave then EOFs and the child
/// exits, exactly as when a terminal window closes) plus a graceful SIGTERM to
/// the process group for any child that doesn't exit on stdin EOF.
/// `@unchecked Sendable`: `masterFd`/`pid`/`queue`/`onData`/`onExit` are immutable
/// (`let`), and every mutable field (`readSource`, `exited`, `fdClosed`) is only
/// ever read or written on the serial `queue` — the read source, exit watcher,
/// `write`, and `terminate` all funnel their state access through it. That serial
/// confinement is the synchronization invariant, so the cross-thread captures
/// below (`[weak self]` from the waitpid thread / dispatch closures) are sound.
