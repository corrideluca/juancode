/// A session's pty is a single shared grid, but several clients may view it at
/// once (the native app's own terminal view + web + phone PWA), each at a
/// different size. Without arbitration every `attach`/`resize` wrote the grid
/// last-write-wins, so with two different-sized viewers the CLI TUI flapped back
/// and forth between their sizes.
///
/// This gives each session a single *controlling* owner: the first client to set
/// the grid claims it and holds it until it disconnects (`release`), at which
/// point the next client's request takes over. The in-process local native view
/// (`GridArbiter.localOwner`) preempts a remote owner, so the primary on-screen
/// surface always drives the grid. A non-owner's request is denied — the caller
/// renders the pty's actual grid as-is instead of fighting for it.
///
/// Thread-safe (its own lock), so `Session` can arbitrate from any queue. Mirrors
/// `apps/server/src/gridArbiter.ts`.
