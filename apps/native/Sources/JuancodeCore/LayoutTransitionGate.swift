/// terminal through a burst of intermediate geometries. The resize throttle keeps
/// the pty in lockstep during a *drag* — which is right there — but for a discrete
/// transition lockstep is wrong: the CLI repaints for each intermediate grid
/// mid-stream and its incremental renderer leaves those garbled frames behind
/// until a manual resync (the "panel toggle garbles the TUI" bug).
///
/// The UI marks the transition here (`begin`) right before mutating the layout;
/// the terminal coordinators then hold every grid push that lands inside the
/// window and, once the layout settles, assert the final grid ONCE with a genuine
/// SIGWINCH so the TUI fully re-lays-out. A plain final resize isn't enough: a
/// net-zero transition (open then close) settles at the grid the pty already has,
/// so no SIGWINCH would fire and the garbled frames would stay on screen.

/// touched on the main thread.
