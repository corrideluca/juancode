# juancode native (Swift)

Native macOS port of juancode where **the app is the server** (epic `juancode-u34`).
A single in-process registry owns the real ptys (claude/codex via `forkpty`, env
untouched), fanning pty output out to N subscribers: the local SwiftUI view AND
remote browser/phone clients over an embedded WS server.

## `JuancodeCore` — the node-pty replacement (`juancode-u34.2`)

Dependency-free Swift library mirroring the server's session layer. SwiftTerm and
the embedded server are *subscribers* to this core (added in u34.3/u34.4), so the
core has no UI/server deps.

| Swift (`Sources/JuancodeCore`) | mirrors (`apps/server/src`) |
| --- | --- |
| `PtyProcess` | node-pty (`forkpty` + `execvp`) |
| `Session` | `session.ts` |
| `SessionRegistry` | `registry.ts` |
| `CodexSessionDiscovery` | `codexSession.ts` |
| `Providers` / `resolveBin` | `providers.ts` / `resolveBin.ts` |
| `ActivityDetector` | `activityDetector.ts` |
| `Scrollback` | `scrollback.ts` |
| `Protocol` (models) | `protocol.ts` |
| `SessionStore` (seam) | `db.ts` surface — in-memory now, GRDB in u34.5 |

### Key invariants

- **Env fidelity by construction.** `PtyProcess` spawns via `forkpty` + `execvp`,
  inheriting `environ` verbatim — no shadow HOME/CODEX_HOME, no envp built. The
  prime directive holds with no careful copying.
- **fork() safety.** All C strings are built in the parent *before* `forkpty`; the
  child calls only async-signal-safe `chdir`/`execvp`/`_exit`. (fork in a
  multithreaded process can't safely `malloc`.)
- **Fan-out.** `Session.subscribeOutput(replay:)` is the seam every consumer uses;
  late subscribers get a scrollback replay, exactly like the WS layer on reattach.
- **Reliable lifecycle.** Exit is detected by a dedicated `waitpid` thread (no
  kqueue/EOF races); `terminate()` sends graceful SIGTERM + closes the master,
  then a SIGKILL backstop after 200ms for children that defer SIGTERM.

### Seams for later tickets

- `SessionStore` — write-path persistence used by `Session`. Default
  `InMemorySessionStore`; the SQLite store lands in `JuancodePersistence` (below).
- Title/usage polling (u34.6) plug in via `SessionEnvironment`.

## `JuancodePersistence` — SQLite store (`juancode-u34.5`)

GRDB-backed `PersistentStore` (a faithful port of `apps/server/src/db.ts`).
Persists session metadata + capped scrollback, GitHub-PR-style inline diff
comments, cached 'Review with Claude' results, and an **FTS5** full-text index
over titles + scrollback — so history and search survive app restarts.

| Swift (`Sources/JuancodePersistence`) | mirrors (`apps/server/src`) |
| --- | --- |
| `GRDBStore` | `db.ts` (`sessionDb` + `commentDb` + `reviewDb`) |

- **Schema-compatible** with the Node `juancode.db`: scrollback is TEXT (a lossy
  UTF-8 view of the raw pty bytes), so the same data dir is readable by either
  implementation. Replay stays faithful because trimming happens on byte
  boundaries upstream (`Scrollback`).
- The only target that depends on GRDB; `JuancodeCore` stays dependency-free.
  The server holds one `GRDBStore` as both the `SessionStore` (handed to the
  registry's `SessionEnvironment`) and the richer `PersistentStore` for queries.

## `JuancodeServices` — auxiliary services (`juancode-u34.6`)

1:1 Swift `Process` ports of the server's shell-out + parse modules. Foundation +
`JuancodeCore` only (no server/UI deps). Every shell-out goes through
`ProcessRunner` (an `execFile` replacement that inherits the environment verbatim —
the prime directive).

| Swift (`Sources/JuancodeServices`) | mirrors (`apps/server/src`) |
| --- | --- |
| `ProcessRunner` | `execFile` (the shared shell-out backbone) |
| `Git` | `git.ts` (diff, state, worktrees, commit, push) |
| `Gh` / `Commit` | `gh.ts` / `commit.ts` (PRs; AI commit message) |
| `Review` | `review.ts` ('Review with Claude') |
| `Beads` / `Status` | `beads.ts` / `status.ts` (bd issues; MCP/auth) |
| `SessionTitle` / `SessionUsage` | `sessionTitle.ts` / `sessionUsage.ts` |
| `RecoverSession` | `recoverSession.ts` (recover an old CLI id) |
| `EphemeralPty` | `editor.ts` + `terminal.ts` (editor/shell ptys) |
| `SessionEnvironment.live(store:)` | the title/usage poll seam wired into `Session` |

Title/usage polling is injected into `Session` via `SessionEnvironment` (the core
stays dependency-free); use `SessionEnvironment.live(store:)` for the real seams.

## `JuancodeServer` — embedded WS+HTTP server (`juancode-u34.3`)

A Hummingbird 2 server that folds the server role into the app. Serves the
`protocol.ts` wire format over `/ws` (mirrors `ws.ts`) and the REST endpoints
(mirrors `index.ts`), so the existing React web app (`apps/web`) works as a
remote client almost unchanged. Remote browser/phone clients subscribe to
registry sessions here; the local SwiftUI view (u34.4) is an in-process
subscriber to the same registry (no WS hop).

| Swift (`Sources/JuancodeServer`) | mirrors (`apps/server/src`) |
| --- | --- |
| `WireProtocol` | `protocol.ts` (`ClientMessage`/`ServerMessage` Codable) |
| `WebSocketConnection` | `ws.ts` (per-connection subs + activity + routing) |
| `JuancodeServer` (routes) | `index.ts` (REST: diff/git/PR/beads/review/…) |
| `AppState` | the `registry` + `sessionDb` + ephemeral singletons |

`AppState` owns one `GRDBStore` (handed to the registry as the `SessionStore`
and used directly as the `PersistentStore` for queries), the `SessionRegistry`
(built with `SessionEnvironment.live`), and the ephemeral editor/terminal ptys.

## `JuancodeApp` — the SwiftUI shell (`juancode-u34.4`)

The native app (`swift run juancode`): the local shell AND the host of the
embedded server. The local UI is an **in-process subscriber** to the same
`SessionRegistry` the server drives — no WS hop for the local view; remote
browser/phone clients attach to the identical registry over `/ws`.

| Swift (`Sources/JuancodeApp`) | role |
| --- | --- |
| `JuancodeApp` (`@main`) | boots `AppState`, starts the embedded server in the background |
| `AppModel` | observable bridge to the registry/store (sessions, activity, create/reactivate/delete) |
| `RootView` / `SidebarView` | `NavigationSplitView` sidebar + session detail |
| `SwiftTermLive` | SwiftTerm `TerminalView` fed by `Session.subscribeOutput` (replay + live); keystrokes/resize → pty |
| `NewSessionView` | provider + cwd + accept-all + worktree → `registry.create` |

Core shell shipped: sidebar with live activity dots, SwiftTerm session view,
new-session + reactivate + delete.

### Panels (`juancode-5za`, shipped)

The `apps/web` panels are now ported to SwiftUI, keyed per work dir off `AppModel`
(`beadsByCwd` / `prsByCwd`):

| `Sources/JuancodeApp` | role |
| --- | --- |
| `ChangesPanel` | git diff with vim-like syntax highlighting + click-drag line-range inline comments + 'Review with Claude' |
| `IssuesPanel` | interactive bd/beads issues per folder (grouped via `BeadsGrouping`); `workOnIssue` dispatches a session |
| `BottomTerminalPanel` | per-workdir shell terminal, VS Code-style tabs + split |
| `SearchPanel` / `StatusPanel` | FTS5 scrollback search; MCP/auth status |
| `EditorOverlay` | in-app file editor modal (ephemeral pty) |
| `RootView` | tabbed right-side panel switching Changes/Issues, docks the bottom terminal |

## Oracle — global orchestrator (`juancode-wjg`)

A persistent global helper docked bottom-right (`OracleDock`), independent of the
focused session/workdir. Two surfaces in one floating panel:

- **Issues** — a global bd tracker living in its own control dir
  (`~/.juancode/oracle`, a git repo with a `.beads` tracker, prefix `oracle-`). It's
  just another cwd, so the existing `getBeads(cwd)` reads it unchanged — no `--db`
  plumbing. Each item offers **Dispatch…** (spawn an agent in a project) and **Ask
  Oracle**.
- **Chat** — a real pinned `claude` session (cwd = the control dir, so it gets
  native bd access + reads `AGENTS.md`). Identified by its unique cwd and hidden
  from the per-project sidebar; restored across launches.

| `Sources/…` | role |
| --- | --- |
| `JuancodeServices/Oracle.swift` | control-dir bootstrap (`git init` + `bd init`), the `dispatch.jsonl` mailbox (append/tail with offset + partial-line safety), the `state.json` snapshot, and the agent's `AGENTS.md` instructions |
| `JuancodeApp/OracleModel.swift` | owns the agent session, tails the mailbox to spawn project agents, keeps `state.json` fresh, exposes the global tracker |
| `JuancodeApp/OracleDock.swift` | the bottom-right overlay: Issues view + dispatch picker + the agent chat terminal |

**Dispatch bridge.** Rather than scraping a TUI pty stream, the Oracle agent (and
the dock UI) append one `OracleDispatch` JSON line to `dispatch.jsonl`; the app
tails it and turns each line into a real session via `AppModel.create` (reusing
worktree isolation). Deterministic, observable, and faithful — the agent uses its
normal file tools, no new network surface. Set `JUANCODE_ORACLE_DIR` to relocate
the control dir (tests do).

## Run

```sh
cd apps/native
swift test                       # unit + integration (core + persistence + services + server)
swift run juancode               # the native SwiftUI app (local shell + embedded server)
swift run juancode-smoke claude  # smoke the core against the real claude CLI
swift run juancode-serve         # boot the embedded WS+HTTP server (headless) on :4280
```

With `juancode-serve` running, point the web dev server at it
(`pnpm --filter @juancode/web dev`) — Vite proxies `/api` + `/ws` to `:4280`.

Requires `claude`/`codex` on PATH for the smoke; tests need neither (fake resolver).
