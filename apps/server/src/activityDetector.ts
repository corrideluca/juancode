/**
 * Infers whether an agent session is working, has finished a turn, or is waiting
 * for the user. There are two signals, and the detector fuses them:
 *
 * 1. **Structured stream** (preferred). The CLIs write an append-only
 *    stream-json transcript as they run; new records appear *only* while the
 *    agent is actively producing a turn (an `assistant` / `thinking` / `tool_use`
 *    / `tool_result` block). {@link Session} tails that transcript and calls
 *    {@link feedStructured} with each batch of normalized events. A batch that
 *    carries any agent-produced event is an unambiguous "the agent is working"
 *    pulse that does not depend on rendered TUI wording at all — robust to CLI
 *    footer/spinner copy changes. This is the headline of juancode-doq.
 *
 * 2. **Rendered PTY screen** (fallback). The raw pty byte stream is fed into a
 *    headless {@link TerminalScreen}, so the detector can read the *actual
 *    rendered screen*. Both `claude` and `codex` paint an "esc to interrupt"
 *    footer while a turn runs and an option-menu / yes-no prompt when they pause
 *    for the user. This path still drives **busy** when no transcript is
 *    available (e.g. before the CLI session id is known, or a provider/mode that
 *    writes no transcript), and — crucially — it is what distinguishes
 *    **waiting_input** from **idle** at turn end, since a permission prompt is
 *    *not* written to the transcript until the user answers it.
 *
 * In both cases the lifecycle is the same: a busy pulse (re)arms a short settle
 * timer and a long watchdog. On settle we re-read the rendered screen — an
 * option menu / yes-no prompt visible => **waiting_input**, otherwise **idle**
 * (unless the working footer is still up *and* we have no structured turn-end
 * yet, in which case we stay busy). The watchdog demotes a stuck busy if both
 * streams go silent.
 *
 * Because busy is only ever entered via a working footer or a structured agent
 * event, the startup banner and the user's own keystroke echoes — which carry
 * neither — are never mistaken for agent activity. Best-effort: with no
 * transcript, a CLI footer-wording change can still defeat the screen patterns,
 * which is exactly why the structured path exists.
