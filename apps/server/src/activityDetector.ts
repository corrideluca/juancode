/**
 * Infers whether an agent session is working, has finished a turn, or is waiting
 * for the user — from the raw pty byte stream alone (we never reimplement the
 * agents, so this is all we have).
 *
 * The signal: both `claude` and `codex` show an "esc to interrupt" status line
 * while they work. They paint that phrase *once* when a turn starts and then
 * only update the changing bits (the elapsed-time counter, token counts) via
 * cursor moves — so the phrase itself is not re-emitted every frame. We use it
 * only to *enter* `busy`; from there any continued output (the ticking timer,
 * streaming tokens) keeps the session busy, and we settle once output goes quiet
 * for `SETTLE_MS`. Because a session can only become busy via the phrase, the
 * startup banner and the user's own keystroke echoes — which never contain it —
 * are never mistaken for agent activity, so we don't fire spurious pings.
 *
 * When a turn settles we classify the final screen: an interactive option menu
 * or yes/no prompt means the agent is waiting for input; anything else means the
 * turn is simply done. This classification is best-effort (it matches Claude's
 * permission menus and common prompts) and a CLI wording change can defeat it —
 * the robust long-term path is the structured stream-json view (juancode-4jq).
