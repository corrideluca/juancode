/**
 * Decides whether an activity transition should actually surface an OS
 * notification, so the firehose of `activity` broadcasts can't turn into a
 * Chrome notification flood.
 *
 * The upstream signal is noisy: the server's activity detector can *flap*
 * busy↔waiting_input for a single parked prompt (every TUI repaint of the
 * "esc to interrupt" footer re-enters busy, then settles back to the same
 * waiting_input with a fresh `notify:true`). Without a gate, each flap is a
 * brand-new Chrome notification for the *same* event — which is exactly the
 * spam this guards against.
 *
 * The gate is a pure decision function (clock injected) so it can be unit
 * tested without a DOM:
 *
 *  - **Per-session same-state dedup** — re-entering a state we just notified
 *    for is dropped for {@link SAME_STATE_COOLDOWN_MS}. This kills detector
 *    flapping (same prompt, repainted) while still letting a genuinely new
 *    turn through once the cooldown lapses.
 *  - **Per-session min interval** — any two notifications for one session are
 *    spaced at least {@link SESSION_MIN_INTERVAL_MS} apart, so even a rapid
 *    waiting_input→idle→… churn can't machine-gun.
 *  - **Global burst coalescing** — if more than {@link GLOBAL_BURST_MAX}
 *    notifications would fire inside {@link GLOBAL_WINDOW_MS} (e.g. many
 *    sessions finishing at once), the overflow collapses into a single
 *    "multiple sessions" summary instead of one-per-session.
